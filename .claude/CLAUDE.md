## Project Structure

Excalidraw is a **monorepo** with a clear separation between the core library and the application:

- **`packages/excalidraw/`** - Main React component library published to npm as `@excalidraw/excalidraw`
- **`excalidraw-app/`** - Full-featured web application (excalidraw.com) that uses the library
- **`packages/`** - Core packages: `@excalidraw/common`, `@excalidraw/element`, `@excalidraw/math`, `@excalidraw/utils`
- **`examples/`** - Integration examples (NextJS, browser script)

## Installing Dependencies

This project uses **Yarn** for package management with Yarn workspaces for the monorepo.

```bash
yarn install    # Install all dependencies (requires Node >=18)
```

Run this from the repository root. It will install dependencies for all packages and the app.

## Development Workflow

1. **Package Development**: Work in `packages/*` for editor features
2. **App Development**: Work in `excalidraw-app/` for app-specific features
3. **Testing**: Always run `yarn test:update` before committing
4. **Type Safety**: Use `yarn test:typecheck` to verify TypeScript

## Running the Project

```bash
yarn start           # Start the dev server (excalidraw-app on localhost)
```

To build for production:

```bash
yarn build           # Build the full app
yarn build:packages  # Build just the library packages (common, math, element, excalidraw)
```

## Development Commands

```bash
yarn test:typecheck  # TypeScript type checking
yarn test:update     # Run all tests (with snapshot updates)
yarn fix             # Auto-fix formatting and linting issues
```

## Architecture Notes

### Package System

- Uses Yarn workspaces for monorepo management
- Internal packages use path aliases (see `vitest.config.mts`)
- Build system uses esbuild for packages, Vite for the app
- TypeScript throughout with strict configuration
